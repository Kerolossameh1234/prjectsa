   <h2>Introduction :</h2>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike
       the <strong>natural intelligence</strong> displayed by humans and animals, which involves
       consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the
       latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually
       labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural'
       intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI
       textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that
       perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
       achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to
       describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with
       the human mind such as "learning" and "problem solving"</li>
